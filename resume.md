## Modernized Maintanence

For a manufactoring company like Ascend, maintanence is essential and expensive. Data on past repairs is key to reducing costs and improving up-times. The existing system for storing this data was showing its age and fragility and keeping it running was starting to get expensive. It had been built in an early version of ASP.NET, used multiple MS Access databases, and ran on an outdated server. Its task scheduling (used for morning emails and data pulls) was unreliable and required daily contact. And, as you might have guessed, ran only in IE and not very quickly. That's where I came in.
