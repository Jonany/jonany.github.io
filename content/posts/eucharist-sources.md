## Introduction

This post will be on-going attempt to centralize the quotations I've found about the Eucharist, particularly in Early Church authors.


## As Body and Blood

St Irenaeus :
“He took from among creation that which is bread, and gave thanks, saying, ‘This is my body.’ THE CUP LIKEWISE, WHICH IS FROM AMONG THE CREATION TO WHICH WE BELONG, HE CONFESSED TO BE HIS BLOOD. He taught the new sacrifice of the new covenant, of which Malachi, one of the twelve [minor] prophets, had signified beforehand: ‘You do not do my will, says the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice at your hands. For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice; for great is my name among the Gentiles, says the Lord Almighty’ [Mal. 1:10–11]. By these words he makes it plain that the former people will cease to make offerings to God; but that in every place sacrifice will be offered to him, and indeed, a pure one, for his name is glorified among the Gentiles” (Against Heresies 4:17:5 [A.D. 189])

“If the Lord were from other than the Father, how could he rightly TAKE BREAD, WHICH IS OF THE SAME CREATION AS OUR OWN, AND CONFESS IT TO BE HIS BODY AND AFFIRM THAT THE MIXTURE IN THE CUP IS HIS BLOOD?” (Against Heresies 4:33–32 [A.D. 189])

“He has declared the cup, a part of creation, to be his own blood, from which he causes our blood to flow; and the bread, a part of creation, he has established as his own body, from which he gives increase unto our bodies. When, therefore, the mixed cup [wine and water] and the baked bread RECEIVES THE WORD OF GOD AND BECOMES THE EUCHARIST, THE BODY OF CHRIST, and from these the substance of our flesh is increased and supported, how can they say that the flesh is not capable of receiving the gift of God, which is eternal life—flesh which is nourished by the body and blood of the Lord, and is in fact a member of him?” (ibid., 5:2)

St Ignatius of Antioch :
“Take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ which has come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God… They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CONFESS THAT THE EUCHARIST IS THE FLESH OF OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, flesh which suffered for our sins and which that Father, in his goodness, raised up again. They who deny the gift of God are perishing in their disputes” (Letter to the Smyrnaeans 6:2–7:1 [A.D. 110])

Council of Nicaea I :
“It has come to the knowledge of the holy and great synod that, in some districts and cities, the deacons administer the Eucharist to the presbyters [i.e., priests], whereas neither canon nor custom permits that they who have no right to offer [the Eucharistic sacrifice] should give THE BODY OF CHRIST to them that do offer [it]” (Canon 18 [A.D. 325])

St Cyril of Jerusalem :
“The bread and the wine of the Eucharist before the holy invocation of the adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, but the invocation having been made, THE BREAD BECOMES THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE WINE THE BLOOD OF CHRIST” (Catechetical Lectures 19:7 [A.D. 350])

“Do not, therefore, regard the bread and wine as simply that; FOR THEY ARE, ACCORDING TO THE MASTER’S DECLARATION, THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST. EVEN THOUGH THE SENSES SUGGEST TO YOU THE OTHER, LET FAITH MAKE YOU FIRM. Do not judge in this matter by taste, but be fully assured by the faith, not doubting that you have been deemed worthy of the body and blood of Christ. . . . [Since you are] fully convinced that the apparent bread is not bread, even though it is sensible to the taste, but the body of Christ, and that the apparent wine is not wine, even though the taste would have it so, . . . partake of that bread as something spiritual, and put a cheerful face on your soul” (ibid., 22:6, 9)

St Augustine :
“CHRIST WAS CARRIED IN HIS OWN HANDS when, referring to his own body, he said, ‘This is my body’ [Matt. 26:26]. For he carried that body in his hands” (Explanations of the Psalms 33:1:10 [A.D. 405])

“I promised you [new Christians], who have now been baptized, a sermon in which I would explain the sacrament of the Lord’s Table. . . . THAT BREAD WHICH YOU SEE ON THE ALTAR, HAVING BEEN SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD OF GOD, IS THE BODY OF CHRIST. THAT CHALICE, OR RATHER, WHAT IS IN THAT CHALICE, HAVING BEEN SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD OF GOD, IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST” (Sermons 227 [A.D. 411])

“What you see is the bread and the chalice; THAT IS WHAT YOUR OWN EYES REPORT TO YOU. BUT WHAT YOUR FAITH OBLIGES YOU TO ACCEPT IS THAT THE BREAD IS THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE CHALICE IS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. This has been said very briefly, which may perhaps be sufficient for faith; yet faith does not desire instruction” (ibid., 272)

Council of Ephesus :
“We will necessarily add this also. Proclaiming the death, according to the flesh, of the only-begotten Son of God, that is Jesus Christ, confessing his resurrection from the dead, and his ascension into heaven, WE OFFER THE UNBLOODY SACRIFICE IN THE CHURCHES, AND SO GO ON TO THE MYSTICAL THANKSGIVINGS, AND ARE SANCTIFIED, HAVING RECEIVED HIS HOLY FLESH AND THE PRECIOUS BLOOD OF CHRIST THE SAVIOR OF US ALL. AND NOT AS COMMON FLESH DO WE RECEIVE IT; GOD FORBID: NOR AS OF A MAN SANCTIFIED AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD ACCORDING TO THE UNITY OF WORTH, OR AS HAVING A DIVINE INDWELLING, BUT AS TRULY THE LIFE-GIVING AND VERY FLESH OF THE WORD HIMSELF. For he is the life according to his nature as God, and when he became united to his flesh, he made it also to be life-giving” (Session 1, Letter of Cyril to Nestorius [A.D. 431])



## Frequency

*From Claude.ai [search](https://claude.ai/chat/c9343f9c-d34b-41e3-9c68-f61eefa43350)*

Based on historical evidence and early Christian writings, it appears that celebrating communion (also known as the Lord's Supper or Eucharist) every Sunday was indeed a common practice in the early Christian church, though practices likely varied somewhat across different communities.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. New Testament evidence: Acts 20:7 mentions Christians gathering on the first day of the week (Sunday) to "break bread," which is often interpreted as a reference to the Lord's Supper.

2. Early Christian writings: Several early Christian documents suggest a weekly practice. For example, the Didache (late 1st or early 2nd century) instructs believers to gather on the "Lord's Day" to break bread and give thanks.

3. Justin Martyr's account: In his First Apology (around 150 AD), Justin Martyr describes Christians gathering on Sunday for readings, prayers, and the Eucharist.

4. Regional variations: While weekly communion seems to have been common, practices likely varied. Some communities may have celebrated it more or less frequently.

5. Historical context: The early church often met in homes, which may have facilitated more frequent communion compared to later, more formalized church structures.

6. Theological importance: The centrality of the Lord's Supper in early Christian worship and theology suggests it was a regular, frequent practice.

It's important to note that while weekly communion appears to have been common, it wasn't necessarily universal or mandated. As the church grew and spread, practices evolved and diversified.

Yes, there are some early church sources that mention or suggest less frequent communion practices. While weekly communion seems to have been common, there's evidence of variation in practice. Here are a few examples:

1. The Apostolic Tradition: This document, traditionally attributed to Hippolytus of Rome (early 3rd century), mentions the practice of reserving the Eucharistic elements for the sick, which could imply less frequent celebration.

2. Tertullian: In his work "On Prayer" (early 3rd century), Tertullian discusses the practice of receiving the Eucharist daily at home, which might suggest that communal celebrations were less frequent.

3. Augustine of Hippo: In his letters (late 4th/early 5th century), Augustine mentions that practices varied. He notes that some received communion daily, while others did so on certain days. He doesn't prescribe a frequency, suggesting local customs differed.

4. Socrates Scholasticus: In his "Ecclesiastical History" (5th century), he mentions that in Alexandria and Rome, there were only two days when the Eucharist wasn't celebrated, implying that daily celebration wasn't universal.

5. Eastern practices: Some Eastern churches developed the practice of the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts, used on weekdays during Lent, suggesting full Eucharistic liturgies might not have been daily.

It's important to note that these sources come from various times and places, reflecting the diversity of practice that developed as the church grew. Also, less frequent communal celebration doesn't necessarily mean less frequent reception, as some practices involved reserving elements for private consumption.

The historical record suggests a range of practices rather than a single, universal norm.

Yes, there are several other early sources that suggest or directly mention a weekly practice of communion. Here are some additional examples:

1. Pliny the Younger: In his letter to Emperor Trajan (around 112 AD), he describes Christians meeting on a "fixed day" (likely Sunday) for worship, which may have included communion.

2. Ignatius of Antioch: In his letters (early 2nd century), he emphasizes the importance of the Eucharist and encourages frequent gatherings, though he doesn't specify a weekly practice explicitly.

3. Irenaeus: In "Against Heresies" (late 2nd century), he discusses the regular practice of the Eucharist, though he doesn't specify the frequency.

4. Cyprian of Carthage: In his writings (3rd century), he refers to the "daily sacrifice" of the Eucharist, which could imply frequent, possibly weekly, celebration.

5. The Apostolic Constitutions: This 4th-century document instructs believers to gather on the "Lord's Day" for worship, including the breaking of bread.

6. John Chrysostom: In his homilies (late 4th/early 5th century), he often refers to weekly communion, though he also laments that some only partake a few times a year.

7. The Council of Elvira (early 4th century): Canon 21 of this council mentions the practice of bringing the Eucharist to church every Sunday, suggesting a weekly celebration.

These sources, along with those mentioned earlier, provide a strong indication that weekly communion was a common practice in many early Christian communities. However, it's important to remember that practices varied across different regions and time periods.
